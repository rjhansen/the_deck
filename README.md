# Why this branch?

Over two days of work we pushed `the_deck` from nothing to a minimum viable
product. We were unable to spend the time to give it the polish and attention
it deserved. So, one Friday night, I decided to do that.

The overall changes are minor: for instance, since `Suit` and `Rank` have no
meaning outside of a `Card`, those `enums` were moved into the `Card` class.

Some old-style STL algorithms were replaced by their modern Ranges
equivalents.
